# Face Recognition Module ‚Äì RoboCO Project

This module provides a Python-based implementation of real-time face recognition using OpenCV. It includes tools for face detection, recognition, and image comparison, suitable for educational and prototyping purposes.

## üìÅ Contents

- **`face_streaming.py`** ‚Äì Captures video from a webcam and performs real-time face recognition.
- **`image_comparison.py`** ‚Äì Compares two images to determine facial similarity.
- **`simple_facerec.py`** ‚Äì A utility class that encapsulates face detection and recognition logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Face Recognition

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition
```


## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Real-Time Face Recognition

To start the webcam-based face recognition:

```bash
python face_streaming.py
```


This script will open your webcam and attempt to recognize faces in real-time.

### 2. Image Comparison

To compare two images for facial similarity:

```bash
python image_comparison.py path_to_image1.jpg path_to_image2.jpg
```


Replace `path_to_image1.jpg` and `path_to_image2.jpg` with the paths to your images.

## üß† How It Works

The `simple_facerec.py` script utilizes OpenCV's Haar cascades for face detection and computes facial embeddings for recognition. It serves as a foundational example for understanding face recognition workflows.
