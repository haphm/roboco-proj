# Simple Examples Module ‚Äì RoboCO Project

This module provides basic Python scripts demonstrating fundamental computer vision techniques using OpenCV. It's designed for educational purposes and to serve as a starting point for more complex applications within the RoboCO project.

## üìÅ Contents

- **`color_recognition.py`** ‚Äì Detects and identifies colors in an image.
- **`display_images.py`** ‚Äì Loads and displays an image using OpenCV.
- **`display_video.py`** ‚Äì Captures and displays video from a webcam.
- **`edge_detection.py`** ‚Äì Applies edge detection algorithms to an image.
- **`rice_img.png`** ‚Äì Sample image used in the examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## üöÄ Usage

To run any of the example scripts, use the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```


Replace `<script_name>.py` with the name of the script you wish to execute.

For example, to run the color recognition example:

```bash
python color_recognition.py
```

## üß† How It Works

- **Color Recognition**: Identifies and labels colors present in an image.
- **Display Images**: Demonstrates how to load and display images using OpenCV.
- **Display Video**: Captures live video from the webcam and displays it in a window.
- **Edge Detection**: Applies edge detection techniques to highlight the edges within an image.
